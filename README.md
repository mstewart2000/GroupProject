# Research Questions
1. How the Plant effect Bacterial?

  a)Does the plant species will affect the bacterial community composition?
  
  b)Does the plant growth age will affect the bacterial community composition?

2. How do the bacterial communities change across time as the various plant species age?

  a) Which bacteria has the greatest effect on plant biomass when the plant is ____ days/weeks old?
  
3. Do bacteria species have an effect on plant root mass (below-ground dry mass)?
