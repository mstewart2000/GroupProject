# Introduction
Soil microbial communities can play a key role in building plant communities. Also individual plants frequently cause changes in soil microbial community composition, and this reciprocal change then continues to affect the growth of neighboring plants or individual plants that subsequently colonize the soil. As this effect increases it can cause interspecific differences and thus affect plant community composition. In addition, the intensity of this interaction varies over time, so we focus on how the intensity of the interaction between plant and microbial populations varies over time. 

In our data, the experimenters mainly collected changes in the soil microbial community associated with individuals of four plant species more than 20 years. Researchers collected soil from four different plant species (dubbed soil host species) and transplanted seedlings of each of the four species into the different soil samples. And the effect of soil microbial on the performance of conspecific and heterospecific seedlings was quantified in a greenhouse experiment that preserved the soil characteristics of these individual plant.

We used this data set to investigate the associated effects of individual plants and soil microbes and whether they change in intensity over time. We proposed relevant questions around this topic.


# Research Questions and Prediction
### Question 1. How the Plant effect Bacterial community composition?

  a)Does the plant species will affect the bacterial community composition?

  b)Does the plant growth age will affect the bacterial community?
  
  c)How do the bacterial communities composition change across time as the various plant species age?
  
### Prediction 1-1.
  Bacterial community composition differed between plant species, and in different plant species, bacterial composition changed with plant growth.
  ![NMDS plots shows the variantion of bacterial community](./Prediction_graph/Question_1.jpeg)
  Figure 1. NMDS plot show the overall variation in bacterial community composition among the different specific plant species. Sand group as a control group without any plant. That group will have large different with other four plant species. Other four plant species will be different with each other, and points will cluster together within same species. 


### Predicition 1-2 (Roshael post your prediction here)



### Question 2. How the Bacterial community effect the plant species?

  a). Do bacteria communities have an effect on plant root mass (below-ground dry mass)?
  
  Prediction: Plant species will have increased below-ground dry mass when the soil host species and the plant species (transplanted seedling) are the same.

Figure 4. Box plot showing that when an Aa seedling of a particular age (Ammophila arenaria) is planted in soil that was hosted by Ammophila, the below-ground dry mass will be significantly higher than if an Aa seedling of that particular age is planted in soil that was from any other soil host species. The x-axis is the soil host species, while the y-axis shows the below-ground dry mass in milligrams.

Figure 5. Box plot showing that when a Ce seedling of a particular age (C. edulis/IcePlant) is planted in soil that was hosted by IcePlant, the below-ground dry mass will be significantly higher than if a Ce seedling of that particular age is planted in soil that was from any other soil host species. The x-axis is the soil host species, while the y-axis shows the below-ground dry mass in milligrams.

  b) Which bacteria has the greatest effect on plant root biomass when the plant is ____ years old?

### Question 3. Which bacteria has the greatest effect on plant biomass when the plant is 4-12 years old?

  Prediction: One of the four bacterial species will cause a significant difference in the below ground mass of the plants in this time frame.
  ![Boxplots showing the expected relationship between the below ground mass and bacterial species, then that one bacterial species compared against all the others](./Thingy.png)
  Figure 6/7. Shows the predicted relationship between the different species of soil bacteria and below ground dry mass as visualized by a boxplot. This shows the expected result that one of the species will apear to cause an increase in below ground dry mass. The next boxplot shows that this difference in fact exists by making the same boxplot but combining the other three bacterial species into a singular group.
