# Research Questions
1. How the Plant effect Bacterial community composition?

  a)Does the plant species will affect the bacterial community composition?
  
  b)Does the plant growth age will affect the bacterial community composition?

2. How the Bacterial community  effect the plant species?

  a)How do the bacterial communities change across time as the various plant species age?

  b) Which bacteria has the greatest effect on plant biomass when the plant is ____ days/weeks old?
  
3. Do bacteria communities have an effect on plant root mass (below-ground dry mass)?

# Hypotheses/Predictions
Question 1:
Bacterial community composition differed between plant species, and in different plant species, bacterial composition changed with plant growth.

2.
Question 3:
Plant species will have increased below-ground dry mass when the soil host species and the plant species (transplanted seedling) are the same.

Figure 4. Boxplot showing that when an Aa seedling of a particular age (Ammophila arenaria) is planted in soil that was hosted by Ammophila, the below-ground dry mass will be sigificantly higher than if an Aa seedling of that particular age is planted in soil that was from any other soil host species. The x-axis is the soil host species, while the y-axis shows the below-ground dry mass in milligrams.

Figure 5. Boxplot showing that when a Ce seedling of a particular age (C. edulis/IcePlant) is planted in soil that was hosted by IcePlant, the below-ground dry mass will be sigificantly higher than if a Ce seedling of that particular age is planted in soil that was from any other soil host species. The x-axis is the soil host species, while the y-axis shows the below-ground dry mass in milligrams.
